DataPlotter
===========

2D Data Plotting application

DataPlotter is built upon wxWidgets 2.8, OpenGL, and FTGL 2.1 (which requires freetype2).  It has been tested under MSW and GTK.

DataPlotter was created as a simple and fast means for visualizing data.  Simply drag-and-drop a file containing delimited numerical data, choose which columns to draw, and look at your data.

Plot interaction is handled with mouse clicks (click-and-drag to pan, right-click-and-drag to zoom), and data can be manipulated by right clicking on curves in the grid below the plot area, and following menu options.  DataPlotter supports a variety of mathematical operations on datasets, including discrete filtering, FFT, and user-specified arethemetic operations.
